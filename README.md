# Puma560Trajectory for a welding 6DOF manipulator

#The project explain and shows two different methods of moving planing to weld a square piece, It is for a example can be used for a more complex piece in car manufacturing. 

# In this jupiter notebook we used these python libraries RoboticsToolBox , Numpy, Matplotlib, Math, SpacialMath and SpacialMath.base.

#We also shared the different animations for the trajectory in the piece welded.
